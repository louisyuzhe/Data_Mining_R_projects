# Implementation and application of Data Mining algorithms and techniques in R

1. Processing and visualizing data: data types, data quality, data preprocessing, measures of similarity, visualization
2. Decision trees: decision tree induction, overfitting, evaluating performance, comparing classifiers
3. Classification: rule-based classifiers, nearest-neighbor classifiers, Bayesian classifiers, support vector machines, neural networks, ensemble methods
4. Association analysis: frequent itemset generation, rule generation, compact representation, evaluation, categorical attributes
5. Cluster analysis: K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, evaluation, self-organizing maps.
6. Anomaly detection: causes, statistical approaches, proximity methods, density methods, clustering methods.
7. Network data (time permitting): centrality and prestige, citation analysis, PageRank, authorities and hubs.
